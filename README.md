# AI_for_Medicine
This repo is a collection of the notebooks that I am using throughout my completion of the AI for Medicine Specialization courses. The specialization is described by course organizers as:  

AI is transforming the practice of medicine. It’s helping doctors diagnose patients more accurately, make predictions about patients’ future health, and recommend better treatments. In this Specialization, you’ll gain practical experience applying machine learning to concrete problems in medicine. You’ll learn how to:
* Diagnose diseases from x-rays and 3D MRI brain images
* Predict patient survival rates more accurately using tree-based models
* Estimate treatment effects on patients using data from randomized trials
* Automate the task of labeling medical datasets using natural language processing

Specifically, I am in the process of completeing course 3, "AI for Medical Treatment" where we are learning to work with BERT and Natural Language Processing Tools.
