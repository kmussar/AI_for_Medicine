# Lecture Notebooks

These notebooks contain code samples and short excercises completed during completion of the AI for Medicine Specialization. For the most part, these notebooks do not contain my original code, but I am sharing them to provide more context on the course material. The code that I've written for the weekly assignments is unfortunatley not publishable due to the Coursera homor code.
